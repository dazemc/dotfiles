# Dotfiles TODO

The work list, in build order. `AGENTS.md` is the constitution; this file is
the queue. Remove items as they land — do not check them off, do not let it
rot.

Authorized work only: the queue grants exactly the steps it lists, top-down,
and never overrides the constitution, `.llm/workflow.md`, or the domain notes
(see `AGENTS.md` → Instruction precedence).

Every step is one action with its own done-criteria. Work top-down, one step
at a time: implement it, verify it in the live session without breaking it
(see `AGENTS.md` → Verify), then remove it. Never remove an unverified step;
never batch multiple steps into one change.

Sizes: S <1 day, M 1–3 days, L 3+ days.

## Authorized work

1. [S] Add a read-only `diagnose.sh` for the link map. It checks symlinks
   resolve, pins resolve, required binaries exist, and no secrets are
   staged — runnable anytime, no sudo, no go-ahead needed to run.
   Done when it catches the known-dead label class and passes on the
   live tree.
